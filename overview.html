		<p>
			rRpg is a Rogue-like text based RPG game. It is composed by the
			<a href="./engine/index.html">engine</a> (the game itself) and a
			<a href="./world-editor/index.html">world editor</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the game, the player will evolve in a randomly generated world
			organised as a grid. The player will always be on a cell of the grid
			and will be able to move in one, some or all the cardinal directions
			(north, east south and west).
		</p>
		<p>
			On the cells he will visit, the player will see many things, such as
			objects to take, non playable characters (NPC) to talk to, places to
			explore (caves, dungeons...), and many others...
